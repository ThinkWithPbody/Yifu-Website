                        I'm a third year Drawing&Painting student from OCAD University.
                        I have no experience in working with html, css and javascript before.
                        Computer programming seems to be a very flexible tool that we can use to create
                        many interesting stuff which could be done manually.
                        I’m not very good with math so programming is a bit changeling to me.
                        I’m going to try my best and see what I could accomplish with programming and
                        maybe also expand my field of art practice with it.
                    </P>

                        The images in the middle are some of my recent works.
                        I’ve been working on mixed-media painting for years and
                        most of them are inspired by nature.
                        I prefer to express myself through paintings rougher than words.
                        Paintings are where I could gather energy from and heal myself.
